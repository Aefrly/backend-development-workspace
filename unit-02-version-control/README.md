# Unit 2
We learned all about Git, GitHub, Version Control, and VS Code.

## Git
- Runs on your computer and tracks your changes to your files
- Tracks your project on your computer
- Mandatory in today's industry of computer science
- The tool developers use to track their progress and manage changes to their codebase
- Git is a type of a version control system

## Version Control
- Compares what's different between two versions
- Reverts to an earlier version if you make a mistake
- Can work on different features without interfering with others
- See who changed what and why
- Records what changes you made, when you made them, and why
- Similar to a journal for your code

## GitHub
- Saves your code online 
- Shares your projects with others
- Collaborate with others in real time
- Backs up your work so you never lose it

- Can create a repository/project folder
- Track changes using commits (a saved record of your work)
- Work on new featurees in branches without touching the main version
- Combine code using merge requests
- Review what you or your team changed, when, and why

## VS Code
- Known as Visual Studio Code
- This is where you will write, run, and debug code
- Has built-in tools for working with Git and GitHub
- Source Control icon allows you to see edited files and is the same as running "git status"
- Pressing the "+" icon will stage your edit and is the same thing as running "git add <FILE_NAME>"
- Type a commit message in the "message" field and press "Commit" and this is the same thing as running "git commit -m "message""
- Press "Sync Changes" to send the changes to GitHub and this is the same thing as running "git push"
