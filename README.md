## Purpose
This is a digital notebook for this course where I can 
track the projects I create, things I have learned, and useful 
reference materials.

## Comprehensive Documentation 
### Overview
This workspace will be very important for everything I do this 
semester. It will include folders for all the different units I 
learn about with specific README.md files to explain the topics. This workspace also has little cheatsheets and important resources I will learn about and need to use.
### Learning Objectives
I want to learn about backend work as much as possible. I have 
mostly only worked on the frontend with programming and can't 
wait to learn how to do things behind the scenes. I also want 
to continue learning more skills to bring into the real world so I can help myself get an internship this summer. 
### How to Use This Repository
This repository has folders dedicated to each unit we cover this semester with README.md files to remind me how things work for that unit. There is also a Git cheatsheet with specific commands that I will use the whole semester. There is a resources space that will include links to all sorts of important resources I will get this semester. Finally, there is a learning log file to document my backend development goals.
